hi# Go AI Tools

This repository contains tools and utilities for working with AI models and services in Go. It includes modules for interacting with the Pinecone vector database and defining shared data structures.

## Project Structure
pinecone/ adddata.go struct/ structure.go

### Key Modules

#### Pinecone Integration (`pinecone/`)

This module provides functions to interact with the Pinecone vector database. It includes utilities for adding data and managing metadata.

- **`Addonestring`**: Adds a single string and its vector to a Pinecone index.
- **`AddTextsToMetadata`**: Adds multiple texts as metadata to a single vector in a Pinecone index.

#### Shared Structures (`struct/`)

The `struct` module defines shared data structures used across the project.

- **`Airesponse`**: A structure to hold AI-related data.

```go
type Airesponse struct {
    Apikey string
    Input  string
    About  string
    Model  string
}

Pinecone Functions
Addonestring
Adds a single string and its associated vector to a Pinecone index.
func Addonestring(indexName, namespace, API, text string, vector []float32)
arameters:

indexName: The name of the Pinecone index.
namespace: The namespace within the index.
API: Your Pinecone API key.
text: The text to be added as metadata.
vector: The vector representation of the text.
AddTextsToMetadata
Adds multiple texts as metadata to a single vector in a Pinecone index.

func AddTextsToMetadata(indexName, namespace, API string, texts []string, vector []float32) error
Parameters:
